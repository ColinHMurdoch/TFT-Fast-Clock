# TFT-Fast-Clock

Adjustable Speed Time Clock for Model Railway Operation using a TFT/LCD display.

## Background

This project is based on a project written by Jim Gifford (Hallet Cove Southern) in June 2017.  This project used a 32 x 8 LED matrix to display the time and was controlled by a nuber of pushbuttons.
[Jim's Project](https://www.hallettcovesouthern.com/track-plan-design-info/arduino-projects/fast-clock/)

I felt that this project was ripe for an update and decided to convert Jim's code to operate using a cheap TFT/LCD touch screen to run on my own layout. This project is the result.

## Hardware

The project uses only two components:
1.  A standard arduino or compatable clone.
2.  A 2.8" MCUFRIEND style TFT-LCD plug-in shield.

The completed project is shown below:
